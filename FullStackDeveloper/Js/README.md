I'm really interested in learning more about the technical side of both projects. I understand the website's source code isn't public (NOT open-source), but would you consider letting me have a look? I'm always trying to improve my skills, and seeing how you've built it would be a great help. I've been working with Jekyll and other tools, and I'm always looking to learn.
